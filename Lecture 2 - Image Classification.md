# Image Classification
---
### Image Classification Pipeline
* **Input**: N images labelled with one of the k different classes
* **Learning**: Our task is to use the training set to learn what every one of the classes looks like. We refer to this step as training a classifier, or learning a model.
* **Evaluation**: Predict labels for new set of images

```python
def train(train_images, train_labels):
    #build model for images -> labels
    return model
```
